# Unreal Engine 5 File Structure Template
 A respository containing a dummy Unreal Engine 5 project. Contains a folder structure that has been premade to help kickstart new Unreal projects. 

I'd strongly recommend following Epic's Standard for Naming Conventions for Assets, found here:
 - https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProductionPipelines/AssetNaming/
 - https://www.tomlooman.com/unreal-engine-naming-convention-guide/

Using these will allow you to search your project easier, and as it gets larger, some things can get very difficult to find - the time saved will be very valuable.
