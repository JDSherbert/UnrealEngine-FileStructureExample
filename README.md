A respository containing a dummy Unreal Engine 5 project. Contains a folder structure that has been premade to help kickstart new Unreal projects. I've found that the way a project is laid out kind of sets the framework for how easily scalable it will be as more development occurs.

I'd strongly recommend following Epic's Standard for Naming Conventions for Assets, found here:
 - https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProductionPipelines/AssetNaming/
 - https://www.tomlooman.com/unreal-engine-naming-convention-guide/
 - https://www.unrealdirective.com/resource/asset-naming-conventions

For Code, see here:
 - https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProductionPipelines/DevelopmentSetup/CodingStandard/

Using these will allow you to search your project easier, and as it gets larger, some things can get very difficult to find - the time saved will be very valuable.

If you'd like to get Unreal Engine and use this project template, please follow these steps:
1. Download the Epic launcher: https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/
2. Install Unreal Engine (whichever version - this template is for 5.1)
3. Clone this project
4. Open it up with your engine, or copy + paste the folder structure from it
5. Profit

Lemme know if you have any questions or feedback!
